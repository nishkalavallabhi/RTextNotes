# RTextNotes
My Notes on using R for text processing, and in general, using R.
I find R documentation troublesome for a programmer who is new to R. I find it a horror for a newbie whose first programming language is R. I am teaching a text analysis course using R and assuming no programming knowledge from students. During the course of time, I realized there is either too little or too much information for some of the topics. My idea is to use this repo to share my notes and code occasionally.
