# RTextNotes
This project contains my Notes on using R for text processing, and in general, using R. I find R documentation troublesome for a learner who is new to both R and Programming. Infact, I find it a horror for a newbie whose first programming language is R. I am teaching a text analysis course using R and assuming no programming knowledge from students. My reason for choosing R instead of Python for this particular course is that we have students from different disciplines who sometimes end up working with text data (e.g.,tweets, news articles etc) to do some project in their own discipline (journalism, sociology etc). Since they may or not may not want to become programmer, and I think a) R is the kind of language they will use with their statistical analyses work anyway and b) R is the kind of language, where you can do more things without really knowing a lot of things about programming, I chose R.

During the course of time, I realized there is either too little or too much information for some of the topics. My idea is to use this repo to share my notes and code occasionally. My syllabus for Spring 2018 version of this course is [here](http://sowmya.public.iastate.edu/Syllabi/410-Spring18-Syllabus.pdf).
